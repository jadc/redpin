# ðŸ“Œ redpin

A [Discord app](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/21334461140375-Using-Apps-on-Discord#h_01J7CJ994TKKMGYMG1ZZQ9T3S5) for saving messages and comparing stats, powered by Golang.

Unlike most pin bots, redpin is highly configurable and flexible, supporting any number of emojis to pin messages; in addition, the bot uses webhooks and modern Discord features for a much more minimal aesthetics compared to other options.

## Motive

This repository contains the modern rewrite of **redpin** in Go. If you are looking for the original python version, see [redpin-py](https://github.com/jadc/redpin-py); I rewrote this bot to practice interfacing with APIs, routing packets, and responding to asynchronous events in the Go programming language.

## Contribution

Install [Nix](https://nixos.org/download) and then run `nix develop` in the root of the repo. This will switch you into a shell with all the dependencies installed.

> [!note]
> Redpin does not have many dependencies, so if you do not want to install Nix, you can read the [flake.nix](flake.nix) file and figure out what you need.
