Install [Nix](https://nixos.org/download) and then run `nix develop` in the root of the repo. This will switch you into a shell with all the dependencies installed.

> [!note]
> Redpin does not have many dependencies, so if you do not want to install Nix, you can read the [flake.nix](flake.nix) file and figure out what you need.
